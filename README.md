## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the projects of the INFO0902 course. 

## Project 1
This project presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of four selection algorithms: SelectionSelect, HeapSelect, QuickSelect, and FRSelect (Floyd-Rivest selection algorithm). The objective of each algorithm is to determine the $k$-th smallest element in an array.

Grade:
- Code: 49/50
- Report: 23/24

## Project 2
The objective of the project is to implement, theoretically analyze, and empirically compare different approximate algorithms to solve the bin packing problem. Implementing these different algorithms will allow you to implement different data structures covered in the course (priority queues and binary search trees).

Grade:
- Code: 45/45
- Report: 29/30
